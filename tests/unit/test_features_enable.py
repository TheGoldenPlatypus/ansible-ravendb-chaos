"""
Tests for ravendb_features kind=enable.

What the kind does:  POST /databases/<db>/admin/features then re-fetch the
                     DatabaseRecord and verify every Add feature is present and
                     every Remove feature is gone.

Hardening pinned here:
  - POST + verify path: returns PASS lines on happy path.
  - POST failure (non-2xx) raises with HTTP status in the message.
  - Verify failure: if the requested Add feature does not appear in the
    DatabaseRecord, the kind raises -- no silent success.
  - Schema flexibility: if the canonical 'DatabaseFeatures' / 'EnabledFeatures'
    / 'Features' field isn't present but the feature name appears anywhere
    in the JSON, verification still passes (catches release-to-release
    schema renames).
  - Empty add+remove: raises ValueError up front (no useless POST).
